## Projects  
### üå± [Subaquatic Vegetation Surveys - Baltimore County & Anne Arundel County](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15wwp6el_BKR4gihspn6cxKzxbaKyjVjT/view?usp=drive_link)  
- During the spring and summer months I lead a team of field researchers and environmental scientists for the yearly SAV surveys for both Anne Arundel and Baltimore Counties in Maryland. This project consists of every single step of the geospatial analysis process from data collection and engineering, to data analysis, visualization, technical reporting, and cartography. 
- The link above will take you to a Google Drive where the PDF verision of the entire project's deliverables are. You will need to have a PDF Viewer such as Adobe, or download the pdf in order to view the document, final reports, maps, and charts.
- A ArcGIS StoryMap has been created and is pending approval for public viewing. 
- Tools: GPS Mapping, Data Collection, Statistical Analysis, Cartography, Data Visualization, Data Analysis, Field Work, ArcGIS StoryMap
- This projectly repeats yearly. For the 2025 year, I have built python scripts to automate the project initiation phase of the project. This consists of updating 80+ Layouts/Field Maps and exporting them, as well as renaming shapefiles and scrubbing data from their attribute tables.

### üîç [Spring and Summer SAV Bed Composite Automation](https://github.com/a-b-1-source/a-b-1-source.github.io/blob/2814ed4ff8bdd321f419cb1463c1aad0db2d825d/Create%20the%20Yearly%20Composites)  
- Developed Python scripts to automate the creation of SAV composite beds for VIMS' monitoring web maps using 2024 data.
- The purpose for this script was to merge the spring and summer surveys to create a yearly outline for the SAV beds in each waterway.
- If you want to test the scripts you will need the SAV Data which can be located [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dZfMBy6YFHtZFXraY-EtB0z1GfYf4Hxg/view?usp=sharing).
- You will need to update and edit the file paths and have access to a cartography software like ArcGIS Pro, ArcMap, or QGIS to view and run the script. The script takes both the spring and summer folders containing the SAV data, and perform a series of geoprocessing tools to output what can be seen in the "Composites_Master" file.   
- Tools: Python, Github, ArcPy, ArcGIS Pro  

### üó∫Ô∏è [Shapefile Statistical Comparison & Analysis](https://github.com/a-b-1-source/a-b-1-source.github.io/blob/9a5980594703cdce793f368f9b80c9a7d1ebe31f/SAV%20Species%20Distribution)  
- Analyzed SAV data for species, density, and acreage trends, comparing datasets across seasons. This data is crucial for enviromental restoration efforts in the county's waterways. Due to the natural geography of Maryland and the environmental importance of these fragile waterways and wetlands, the data is crucial for environmental engineering efforts such as shoreline restoration, dredging, marina design and engineering, and is a key indicator for the overall environmental health of the waterways.
- Tools: ArcGIS Pro, Python 

### üåä [Drone Mapping & Aerial Photography]() **COMING SOON** 
- As a recently certified FAA Part 107 Drone Pilot (November 2024), I am just beginning in my efforts to understand the importance of drones and UAS in various applications.
- 50+ Hours in FPV flight simulators
- This section will be updated with a link to a portfolio of photos and videos.

- Led teams of researchers conducting field observations
- Worked amongst a team of reasearchers collecting data using data-collectors and various survey equipment

### Other Professional Experience
- Prior to the start of 2024, I worked in sales for 3 years. In one of those roles I served as a retained technical recruiter in the Climate-Technology Industry. I worked with Private Equity, and Venture Capital backed companies to grow their teams from the director level, to board executives. Though this experience is not entirely relevant to my current work, I am happy to showcase the skills I gained from working as such. I have sharp interpersonal skills and 3 years of sales experience. I have done lead generation, lead sales meetings, provided sales support and customer support while generating revenue for my employers. 
- I spoke, and communicated with C-Suite executives on a daily basis, reporting and introducing new candidates in the hiring pipeline, and managed each individual search as it's own project. I have successfully placed Chief Technology Officers, a Chief Development and Commercialization Officers, Chief Financial Officers, a VP of Engineering, a Director of Fermentation, etc... 
- I worked in employee benefits and group insurance between 2021 and 2022, while persuring a CEBS designation from the University of Pennsylvania. I achieved my GBA 1, and learned a significant amount about group insurance, underwriting, sales, and client engagement. I will happily share more information regarding this expereince upon request.
