## Projects  
### üå± [Subaquatic Vegetation Surveys - Baltimore County](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15wwp6el_BKR4gihspn6cxKzxbaKyjVjT/view?usp=drive_link)  
- During the spring and summer months I lead a team of field researchers and environmental scientists for the yearly SAV surveys for both Anne Arundel and Baltimore Counties in Maryland. This project consists of every single step of the geospatial analysis process from data collection and engineering, to data analysis, visualization, technical reporting, and cartography. 
- The link above will take you to a Google Drive where the PDF verision of the entire project's deliverables are. You will need to have a PDF Viewer such as Adobe, or download the pdf in order to view the document, final reports, maps, and charts.
- A ArcGIS StoryMap is in progress and will be published here. 
- Tools: GPS Mapping, Data Collection, Statistical Analysis, Cartography, Data Visualization, Data Analysis, Field Work

### üîç [Spring and Summer SAV Bed Composite Automation](https://github.com/a-b-1-source/a-b-1-source.github.io/blob/2814ed4ff8bdd321f419cb1463c1aad0db2d825d/Create%20the%20Yearly%20Composites)  
- Developed Python scripts to automate the creation of SAV composite beds for VIMS' monitoring web maps using 2024 data.
- The purpose for this script was to merge the spring and summer surveys to create a yearly outline for the SAV beds in each waterway.
- If you want to test the scripts you will need the SAV Data which can be located [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dZfMBy6YFHtZFXraY-EtB0z1GfYf4Hxg/view?usp=sharing).
- You will need to update and edit the file paths and have access to a cartography software like ArcGIS Pro, ArcMap, or QGIS to view and run the script. The script takes both the spring and summer folders containing the SAV data, and perform a series of geoprocessing tools to output what can be seen in the "Composites_Master" file.   
- Tools: Python, Github, ArcPy, ArcGIS Pro  

### üó∫Ô∏è [Shapefile Statistical Comparison & Analysis](https://github.com/a-b-1-source/a-b-1-source.github.io/blob/9a5980594703cdce793f368f9b80c9a7d1ebe31f/SAV%20Species%20Distribution)  
- Analyzed SAV data for species, density, and acreage trends, comparing datasets across seasons. This data is crucial for enviromental restoration efforts in the county's waterways. Due to the natural geography of Maryland and the environmental importance of these fragile waterways and wetlands, the data is crucial for environmental engineering efforts such as shoreline restoration, dredging, marina design and engineering, and is a key indicator for the overall environmental health of the waterways.
- Tools: ArcGIS Pro, Python 

### üåä [Drone Mapping & Aerial Photography]()  
- As a recently certified FAA Part 107 Drone Pilot (November 2024), I am just beginning in my efforts to understand the importance of drones and UAS in various applications.
- 50+ Hours in FPV flight simulators
- This section will be updated with a link to a portfolio of photos and videos.

### Boat Operator & Field Researcher  
- Managed research and survey vessels for subaquatic vegetation monitoring in Baltimore and Anne Arundel counties.
- Successfully led the 2024 Baltimore and Anne Arundel County SAV Surveys as the primary responsible employee, including boat operation and trailer transportation.
- Performed on the fly boat maintenance.

### Other Professional Experience
- Prior to the start of 2024, I worked as a retained technical recruiter in the Climate-Technology Industry. I worked with Private Equity, and Venture Capital backed companies to grow their teams from the director level, to board executives. Though this experience is not entirely relevant to my current work, I am happy to showcase the skills I gained from working as such.
- I spoke, and communicated with C-Suite executives on a daily basis, reporting and introducing new candidates in the hiring pipeline, and maanged each individual search as it's own project. I have successfully placed Chief Technology Officers, a Chief Development and Commercialization Officers, Chief Financial Officers, a VP of Engineering, a Director of Fermentation, etc... I will happily share more information regarding this expereince upon request.
