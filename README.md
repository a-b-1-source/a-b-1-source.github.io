## Projects  
### 🔍 [Spring and Summer SAV Bed Composite Automation](https://github.com/a-b-1-source/a-b-1-source.github.io/blob/2814ed4ff8bdd321f419cb1463c1aad0db2d825d/Create%20the%20Yearly%20Composites)  
- Developed Python scripts to automate the creation of SAV composite beds for VIMS' monitoring web maps using 2024 data.
- The purpose is to merged the spring and summer surveys to create a yearly outline for the SAV beds in each waterway.
- Found within the same repository, you will see examples of scripts I created to help automate and perform data analysis and run geoprocessing tools. If you want to test the scripts you will need the SAV Data which can be located [here] ().
- You will need to update and edit the file paths and have access to a cartography software like ArcGIS Pro, ArcMap, or QGIS to view.   
- Tools: Python, ArcPy, ArcGIS Pro  

### 🌱 [Subaquatic Vegetation Surveys](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15wwp6el_BKR4gihspn6cxKzxbaKyjVjT/view?usp=drive_link)  
- Conducted SAV surveys in Chesapeake Bay, analyzing species density trends using geospatial methods.  
- The link above will take you to a Google Drive where the PDF verision of the entire project's deliverables are. You will need to download the pdf in order to view the document and final reports.
- A ArcGIS StoryMap is in progress and will be published here. 
- Tools: GPS Mapping, Data Collection, Statistical Analysis, Cartography, Data Visualization, Data Analysis.  

### 🌊 [Stream Monitoring Downstream of Construction Sites]()  
- Monitored and reported on environmental impacts downstream of construction sites to ensure compliance with local regulations.  

### 🗺️ [Shapefile Statistical Comparison & Analysis](https://github.com/a-b-1-source/a-b-1-source.github.io/blob/9a5980594703cdce793f368f9b80c9a7d1ebe31f/SAV%20Species%20Distribution)  
- Analyzed SAV data for species and acreage trends, comparing datasets across seasons.  
- Tools: ArcGIS Pro, Python

## Work Experience  
### Environmental Scientist / GIS Analyst  
**Bayland Engineers, Designers, and Consultants** | *Annapolis, MD*  
- Specializing in Chesapeake Bay restoration and GIS solutions for ecological projects.  

### Boat Captain & Field Researcher  
- Managed research and survey vessels for subaquatic vegetation monitoring in Baltimore and Anne Arundel counties.

### Other Professional Experience
- Prior to the start of 2024, I worked as a retained technical recruiter in the Climate-Technology Industry. I worked with Private Equity, and Venture Capital backed companies to grow their teams from the director level, to board executives. Though this experience is not entirely relevant to my current work, I am happy to showcase the skills I gained from working as such. I spoke with and communicated with C-Suite executives on a daily basis, reporting and introducing new candidates in the hiring pipeline. I have placed Chief Technology Officers, Chief Development and Commercialization Officers, Chief Finance Officers, VP of Engineering, Director of Fermentation, etc... I will happily share more information regarding this expereince upon request.
